# 👋 Hi, I'm Zia Ur Rehman

**Software Developer | Backend & Frontend | AWS Learner | Ex-Northvolt**

I’m a developer with hands-on experience in building full-stack applications and supporting real-time production environments. My background spans both web development and manufacturing support—giving me a unique perspective on how digital systems and physical processes intersect.

🔧 **Currently working with:**
- React · Next.js · TypeScript · Node.js · Python  
- PostgreSQL · MongoDB · Docker · GitHub Actions · AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda)

🧠 **Currently learning:**  
- AWS Cloud (Solutions Architect track)  
- Scalable architecture design  
- Deeper frontend UX with Tailwind and animation frameworks

⚡ **Previously at Northvolt**  
Led cross-functional coordination between automation, engineering, and operations to keep battery production running smoothly. While I wasn’t coding daily, I solved complex machine/system issues, documented processes, and learned more about MES/PLC systems than many of the specialized teams I supported.

🌱 **Developer Goals**  
Build tools that are useful, efficient, and human-focused. Explore edge cases where software meets real-world systems. Contribute to open source and deploy full-stack projects with cloud integration.
